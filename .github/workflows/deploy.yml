          # Note: The action 'w9jds/firebase-action' is common but 'firebase-tools' can be run directly via npx or similar.
          # However, the most robust way is creating a standardized step with 'firebase-tools' installed or using a specific action.
          # Let's use the 'w9jds/firebase-action' which is very popular for this.

      # Rewriting the deploy step to use the popular community action for simplicity and reliability
